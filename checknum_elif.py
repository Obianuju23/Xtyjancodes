#Programming Task
#Can you create a program to check whether a number is positive or negative or 0?

#To create this program, create a variable named number and assign a float value to it based on the user input. Then using a if statement, check if the number variable is positive or negative or 0.

#If number is positive, print "The number is positive"
#If number is 0, print "The number is 0"
#If number is negative, print "The number is negative"
